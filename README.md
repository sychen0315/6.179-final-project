# 6.179-final-project
This a simple 2-player dice game. The game will randomly choose one to start. Each time, the player can choose the number of dice to roll (between 1 to 10). If any die has a value as 1, this the player will only score 1; otherwise the player will score the sum of all dice value. The one reaches 100 first will win.

Good luck have fun!
